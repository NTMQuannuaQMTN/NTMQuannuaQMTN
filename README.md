## Hi there üëã, I'm Nguy·ªÖn Tr∆∞∆°ng M·∫°nh Qu√¢n, glad to see you here!

I'm a high school student studying in VNUHCM High School for the Gifted. I am an amateur (or junior, I don't know accurately) front-end web app developer.

- Grade 9: Second Prize in Citywide Contest of Fast Calculation with Calculators

## Repos
Actually I have a lot of repos, but some of them are finished projects, and others are the abandoned one, lmao.
My finished projects:
- Grade 9: EZ-Komu (Repo name: [Quan-Quang-Phuoc-8A13](https://github.com/NTMQuannuaQMTN/Quan-Quang-Phuoc-8A13)) for the National Competition for Designing & Building Technologies for People with Disabilities. EZ-Komu is a communication-assistant tool for individuals with muteness and deafness.
- Grade 9: Class portfolio (Repo name: [8A13-MV-Class](https://github.com/NTMQuannuaQMTN/8A13-MV-Class/)) for the class.
- I focused too much on Math in Grade 10, so no repo at that time.
- Grade 11: Connect4 Replica (Repo name: [Connect4Personal](https://github.com/NTMQuannuaQMTN/Connect4Personal)) for fun.
- Grade 11: Number memory game (Repo name: [NumberMem](https://github.com/NTMQuannuaQMTN/NumberMem)) for fun.
- Grade 11: SingMyTone (Repo name: [SingMyTone](https://github.com/NTMQuannuaQMTN/SingMyTone)) - A tool converting the song pitch to match your voice. Positively impacting about 100 users.
